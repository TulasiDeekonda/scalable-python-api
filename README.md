# Scalable Python API

This repository reflects my approach to building structured backend services using Python. The focus of this project is on clean architecture, validation, security practices, and maintainable service design.

## Project Intent

Rather than building a simple CRUD demo, this project is structured to resemble a production-style backend service. It emphasizes:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Service-oriented design
- Validation and data integrity
- Secure password handling
- Scalable project structure

## Technology Direction

This project is being structured around:

- FastAPI for API development
- SQLAlchemy for data modeling
- Pydantic for request validation
- Secure password hashing practices

The goal is to demonstrate backend fundamentals in a clean, extensible manner.
